Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM) is a software pattern.  Thus it is not a specific technology, but is a particular way of writing software.

MVVM originated at Microsoft, but has since been applied to other technologies.  Much of the information in this presentation is distilled from two channel9 presentations that are referenced in the documentation of the [MVVM Light Toolkit](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/):
* [TechDays 2010: Understanding the Model-View-ViewModel pattern](http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvmvideo1)
* [Deep Dive MVVM](http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvmvideo2)


We will examine MVVM in 4 parts:

1. Closely related patterns
   * Passive View
   * Presentation Model
   * Model View Controller (MVC)
3. Why use MVVM?
   * Testability
   * Maintainability
   * "Blendability"
2. Frameworks that utilize the MVVM pattern
4. Examples
